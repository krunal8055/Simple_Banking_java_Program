A bank maintains two kinds of accounts - Savings Account and Current Account. The savings account provides compound interest, deposit and withdrawal facilities. The current account only provides deposit and withdrawal facilities. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance. If balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed. Create a class Account that stores customer name, account number, and type of account. From this derive the classes Curr-acct and Sav-acct. Include the necessary methods in order to achieve the following tasks.


a. Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.

b. Display the balance.

c. Compute interest and add to balance.

d. Permit withdrawal and update the balance (Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty if necessary).
